<h1>Student Planner API</h1>
<br>
<p>My Student Planner API is an API created using the ASP.NET Framework Version 6, involving the c# programming language using the swaggerUI and relying on local SQL Server Databases to manage the data.</p>
<p> Also acts as a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) Which helps students manage their assignments, and their due dates sorting the classes by class name and the overall weight of the assignment, which can help show which classes give priority.</p>
